# Sydr Benchmark

This repository contains applications for benchmarking Sydr (Symbolic
DynamoRIO). These applications were used to evaluate Sydr in
["Sydr: Cutting Edge Dynamic Symbolic Execution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09269)
paper.

## Sydr

Sydr is a dynamic symbolic execution tool that uses
[DynamoRIO](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio) for concrete execution and
[Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton) for symbolic execution.
