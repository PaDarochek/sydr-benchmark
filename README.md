# Sydr Benchmark

This repository contains applications for benchmarking Sydr (Symbolic
DynamoRIO). These applications were used to evaluate Sydr in upcoming "Best
Practices for Dynamic Symbolic Execution" paper.

## Sydr

Sydr is a dynamic symbolic execution tool that uses
[DynamoRIO](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio) for concrete execution and
[Triton](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Triton) for symbolic execution.
